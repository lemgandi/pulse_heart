This sketch flashes the open heart circuitboard
(http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/openheart/ ) every time your heart
beats, using the Arduino PulseSensor module ( http://pulsesensor.com/
) to detect heartbeats.  Use the Arduino IDE to compile it and load it
into your Arduino.  I have verified that it works on my Arduino Uno.

Plug the detector into the first sensor pin, +5V, and ground as
detailed in the pulsesensor "getting started" guide.  You can use a
F-to-F breakaway header block to plug the heart array into pins 8
through 13 of your Arduino.  You can of course change values in the
sketch as you wish.

The "Heart" array in the top of the pulse_heart.ino file contains the
patterns which will flash when this software detects a heartbeat. Each
array of (char) array of 27 digits represents a pattern which will
flash across the board.  The "blinkdelay" and "runspeed" numbers
govern how long the flash will last; if you alter these, you may find
that the LED board cannot keep up with your heartbeats, which are
typically occur around once a second.

Happy Hacking!
